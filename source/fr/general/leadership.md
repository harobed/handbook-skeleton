This page contains leadership pointers.
The first couple of headers indicate what group it applies to.

## Team members

1. At [Company name] leadership is requested from everyone, whether an individual contributor or part of the leadership team.
2. As a leader, [Company name] teammate will follow your behavior, always do the right thing.
3. Everyone that joins [Company name] should consider themselves to be an ambassador of our [values](values.md).
4. Behavior should be consistent inside and outside the company, don't fake it outside, just do the right thing inside the company as well.
5. [Company name] respects your judgment of what is best for you, afterall you know yourself best. If you have a better opportunity somewhere else don't stay at [Company name] out of a sense of loyalty to the company.
6. In tough times people will put in their best efforts when they do it for each other.
7. We work async, lead by example and make sure people understand that things need to be written down in issues as they happen.
8. We are not a democratic or consensus driven company. People are encouraged to give their comments and opinions. But in the end one person decides the matter after they have listened to all the feedback.
9. It is encouraged to disagree and have a constructive confrontation but please [argue intelligently](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/28/daniel-dennett-rapoport-rules-criticism/).
10. We value truth seeking over cohesion.
11. We avoid meetings because those don't support the asynchronous work flow, are hard to conduct due to timezone differences and are limited only to those attending them, making it harder to share.
12. Start meetings on time, be on time yourself, don't ask if everyone is there, and don't punish people that have shown up on time by waiting for anyone or repeating things for people that come late. When a meeting unblocks a process or decision, don't celebrate that but instead address the question: how can we avoid needing a meeting in the future to unblock?
13. We give feedback, lots of it, don't hold back on suggestions to improve.
14. If you meet external people always ask what they think we should improve.
15. As [Paul Graham said](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/802102152319606784): strive to make the organization simpler.
16. Saying something to the effect of "as you might have heard", "unless you've been living in a cage you know", "as everyone knows", or "as you might know" is toxic. The people that know, don't need it to be said. The people that don't know feel like they missed something. They will be afraid to ask about the context since they don't want to look like they are out of the loop.


## Management team

1. When times are great be a voice of moderation, when times are bad be a voice of hope.
2. To maintain an effective organization, a managers span of control should be around 7, ranging anywhere from 4 to 10. Below this range the inefficiency of an extra organizatinal layer is larger than the benfit of a specialized group. Above this range the manager don't have time to do proper 1:1's anymore.
3. If you praise someone try to do it in front of an audience. If you give suggestions to improve, do it 1 on 1.
4. As soon as you know you'll have to let someone go, do it immediately. The team member is entitled to know where they stand. Delaying it for days or weeks causes problems with confidentiality (find out that they will be let go), causation (attributing it to another reason), and escalation (the working relationship is probably going downhill).
5. When performance or behavior is below par or not in line with our [values](values.md) we normally put someone on a [performance improvement plan (PIP)](). However there are some exceptions to following the PIP process but in all cases managers should speak to the people operations generalist or Chief Culture Officer early on to evaluate the best solution.
6. Not all underperformance should be in a PIP. You may just need to realign them. Take off some tasks and see if they improve.
7. When addressing underperformance, don't wait. Set appropriate goals upfront, both parties are clear.
8. Understand that there are different ways to get to the same goal. There are different perspectives and discussions need to happen.
9. When someone says they are considering quitting drop everything and listen to them. Ask questions to find out what their concerns are. If you delay, the person will not feel valued and the decision will be irreversible.
10. In addition to announcing new team member arrivals, departures are also announced in the #general chat channel (once the Google Slack accounts are blocked, see the [offboarding page](/handbook/offboarding) and the [offboarding checklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/employment/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/offboarding.md) for details. We must respect the privacy of the individual concerned. If you are asked why someone has left or is leaving, please refer that person to the [general guidelines](/handbook/general-guidelines/#not-public) section of the handbook where we describe what can and cannot be shared.
11. People should not be given a raise or a title because they ask for it or threaten to quit. We should pro-actively give raises and promote people without people asking. If you do it when people ask you are disadvantaging people that don't ask and you'll end up with many more people asking.
12. Don't refer to [Company name] teammate [as family](https://hbr.org/2014/06/your-company-is-not-a-family). It is great that our team feels like a close-knit group and we should encourage that, this builds a stronger team. But _families_ and _teams_ are different. _Families_ come together for the relationship and do what is critical to retain it. _Teams_ are assembled for the task and do what is required to complete it. Don't put the relationship above the task. Besides, families don't have an an [offboarding process](/handbook/offboarding/), families should have unconditional love, teams have conditional love. [The best companies are supporters of families.](https://twitter.com/myriadwill/status/917772249624702976)
13. Praise and credit the work of your reports to the rest of the company, never present it as your own. This and many other great lessons in [an ask metafilter thread worth reading](http://ask.metafilter.com/300002/My-best-manager-did-this).
14. Try to be aware of your [cognitive biases](https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18).
15. Great article about [how to think about PIPs](https://mfbt.ca/how-i-talk-to-leaders-about-firing-people-8149dfcb035b), although our time scales are shorter.
16. Do everything to unblock people. For example, if someone has a question that is keeping them from being productive, try to answer the question or find someone who can.
17. Communicate in a professional manner as though your words will be shared widely (e.g. published in a newspaper).
18. Employ multimodal communication to broadcast important decisions. To reach our distributed organization announce important decisions on the team call, email the appropriate team email lists, Slack the appropriate channels, and target 1:1's or other important meetings on the same day, with the same information
19. You are expected to [respond on social media](/handbook/marketing/social-media-guidelines/).
20. Make sure your reports experience a [sense of progress](http://tomtunguz.com/progress-principle/) in their work.
21. A tweet by [Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama/status/804138512878473220) combined the reply by [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/804209365305659392) says it best: "People either get shit done or they don't. And it's easy to be tricked because they can be smart but never actually do anything." Watch for results instead of articulate answers to questions, otherwise you'll take too much time to identify under-performers.
22. [Our summits](/culture/summits) are meant for informal communication and bonding across the company. There is a limited time for business activities during the summit so all our regular meetings should happen outside of the summit. We want informal, cross team, open-ended meetings, that includes individual contributors. For example, inviting everyone including sales to suggest currently missing functionality in [Company name]. Formal, team restricted, structured meetings, where not everyone is welcome shouldn't happen. For example, an executive team meeting to set the yearly budget. Never delay a decision until the summit, if anything use the summit as a deadline to get things done earlier.
23. We don't have explicit 20% time at [Company name]. We measure results and not hours. If people are getting good results in the work that is assigned to them they are free to contribute to other parts of the company or work on a pet project. Don't say "your work on the pet project is hurting your performance" but say "we agreed to getting X done but it is delayed, what happened and how can I help?".
24. Pick a metric before launching something new. 9 out of 10 launches fail. If a project is not working out shut it down completely. Starving a team of headcount to have it die a slow death is not frugal nor motivating. Fund the winners which will still take years to break even.
25. Do not discuss raises in advance because the salary calculator may change before the amount of the raise is decided.
26. Instead of prescribing a direction to your reports it is best to ask ask questions following the [Socratic debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) until you're happy with the direction. Your reports will have deeper knowledge in a more narrow area, so it is easy to draw a different conclusion because they base it on different data. That is why the questions are so important.
27. From the [common injunction at Berkshire](https://www.hb.org/the-psychology-of-human-misjudgment-by-charles-t-munger/): "Always tell us the bad news promptly. It is only the good news that can wait.". Make sure to inform your manager of bad news as quickly as possible. Promptly reporting bad news is essential to preserving the trust that is needed to recover from it.
28. Try to avoid military analogies. We're not an army, we're not at war, there is no battle, we're not killing anyone, and we don't have weapons. Military language is [not inclusive](https://www.london.edu/faculty-and-research/lbsr/killing-the-competition) and can lead to zero sum thinking. We take competing and winning very seriously, but there is no need to describe physical violence. Similarly, non-collaborative and aggressive terms like "rockstar" and "badass" put up walls between people. If a term is are standard in the industry, for example [killing a Unix process](https://shapeshed.com/unix-kill/#how-to-kill-a-process), it is acceptable to use it because that is more efficient. Do use primary-secondary instead of master-slave for replication mechanisms.
