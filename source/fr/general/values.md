## CREDIT

[Company name]'s six values are **Collaboration**, **Results**, **Efficiency**, **Diversity**, **Iteration**, and **Transparency**, and together they spell the **CREDIT** we give each other by assuming good intent.
Our values are interlinked and work with one another to protect our culture. They are made actionable below.

### Collaboration

Helping others is a priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that you are trying to achieve. Similarly, you can rely on others for help and advice—in fact, you're expected to do so.
Anyone can chime in on any subject, including people who don't work at [Company name]. The person who's responsible for the work decides how to do it, but they should always take each suggestion seriously and try to respond and explain why it may or may not have been implemented.

1. **Kindness** We value caring for others. Demonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback. We disagree with companies that say [Evaluate People Accurately, Not "Kindly"](https://inside.bwater.com/publications/principles_excerpt). We're all for accurate assessment, but we think it must be done in a kind way. Give as much positive feedback as you can, and do it in a public way.
2. **Teach** There are aspects of [Company name] culture, such as working asynchronously and extreme transparency, that are unintuitive to outsiders and new team members. Be willing to invest in people and start a dialog around situations such as making a private issue public so that we can all learn from the experience.
3. **Negative is 1-1** Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible. One-on-one video calls are preferred.
4. **Say thanks** Recognize the people that helped you publicly, for example in our [#thanks chat channel](communication.md#Say-Thanks).
5. **Give feedback effectively** Giving feedback is challenging, but it's important to deliver it effectively.
When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself, focus on the business impact and not the person. Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example. If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account. An example of giving positive feedback is our [thanks chat channel]((communication.md#Say-Thanks)). For managers, it's important to realize that employees react to a negative incident with their managers [six times more strongly](https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-delicate-art-of-giving-fee) than they do to a positive one. Keeping that in mind, if an error is so inconsequential that the value gained from providing criticism is low, it might make sense to keep that feedback to yourself. In the situations where negative feedback must be given, focus on the purpose for that feedback: to improve the employee’s performance going forward.
Give recognition generously, in the open, and often to [generate more engagement](http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=LOW14298USEN) from your team.
6. **Get to know each other** We use a lot of text-based communication, and if you know the person behind the text, it will be easier to prevent conflicts. So encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level through TODO.
7. **Don't pull rank** If you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company, you're doing something wrong. People already know we have a hierarchical decision-making process. Explain
why you're making the decision, and respect everyone irrespective of their function.
8. **Address behavior, but don't label people**  There is a lot of good in [this article](http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/the_no_asshole_.html) about not wanting jerks on our team, but we believe that **jerk** is a label for behavior rather than an inherent classification of a person.  We avoid classifications.
9. **Say sorry** If you made a mistake apologize, saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength. The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes. Additionally,
when we share our mistakes and bring attention to them, others can learn from us, and the same mistake is less likely to repeated by someone else.
10. **No ego** Don't defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake. You are not your work; you don't have to defend your point. You do have to search for the right answer with help
from others.
11. **See others succeed** A candidate who has talked to a lot of people inside GitLab mentioned that, compared to other companies, one thing stood out the most: everyone at here mentioned wanting
to see each other succeed.
12. **People are not their work** Always make suggestions about examples of work, not the person. Say, "you didn't respond to my feedback about the design," instead of, "you never listen". And, when receiving feedback, keep in mind that feedback is the best way to improve and that others want to see you succeed.
13. **Do it yourself** Our collaboration value is about helping each other when we have questions, need critique, or need help. No need to brainstorm, wait for consensus, or [do with two what you can do yourself](https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/collaboration-is-the-enemy-of-innovation.html).
